![ufopic.jpg](https://github.com/PlainJane20/UFO-Sightings-Java/blob/main/UFO-Level%201/static/images/ufopic.jpg)

For this assignment, I created a web page with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and D3.js to create tables dynamically utilizing Document Object Model (DOM) programming interface based on a given dataset ([UFO Sightings Data](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). Users will also need to filter the table data for specific values based on search criteria

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

Here, I have created a basic HTML web page.
Appended a table with the following columns to the webpage which has new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Date/time
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape
* Comment
Created an input tag which would filter the date/time column according to the provided input and render the filtered table to the webpage.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

Here, I have created multiple input tags to filter the data.
Created input tags for
* Date/time
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape
Based on the search criteria, the filtered table would be generated.
