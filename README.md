For this assignment, I created a web page with `JavaScript`, `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `D3.js` to create tables dynamically utilizing Document Object Model (DOM) programming interface based on a given dataset ([UFO Sightings Data](https://github.com/PlainJane20/UFO-Sightings-Java/blob/main/UFO-Level%201/static/js/data.js)). Users can also filter the table data for specific values based on search criteria.

## Background

Created a web page with `JavaScript`, `HTML5`, `CSS3`, and `D3.js` to create tables dynamically utilizing Document Object Model (DOM) programming interface based on a given dataset. Users will also need to filter the table data for specific values based on search criteria


## Objectives

* Create a custom `HTML` web page
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of `JavaScript` objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting
* Make sure there are columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least
* Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input
